# Code Comprehension Skill

## Overview
This skill teaches methodologies for understanding code logic flow, analyzing codebases, and extracting architectural insights.

## Principles
- **Systematic Analysis**: Follow structured approach to code understanding
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify design patterns and anti-patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Understand code within its environment
- **Documentation**: Document findings clearly

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Static Analysis
- Parse AST
- Extract control flow graphs
- Identify data flow patterns

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Identify design patterns
- Detect code smells
- Recognize architectural patterns

### 3. Logic Flow Analysis
- Trace execution paths
- Identify entry and exit points
- Map function call sequences

## When to Use This Skill
Load this skill when:
- Analyzing existing code
