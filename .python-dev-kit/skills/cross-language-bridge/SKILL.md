# Cross-Language Bridge Skill

## Overview
This skill teaches how to map concepts between Python, Java, and C++, translating patterns and adapting idioms across languages.

## Principles
- **Concept Mapping**: Map language concepts, not just syntax
- **Idiom Adaptation**: Adapt to target language idioms
- **Best Practices**: Follow target language conventions
- **Trade-off Awareness**: Understand performance and paradigm differences

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Type Mapping
- Map types between languages
- Handle type system differences
- Adapt to static vs dynamic typing

### 2. Pattern Mapping
- Translate design patterns
- Adapt language-specific patterns
- Choose appropriate alternatives

### 3. Framework Mapping
- Map frameworks to equivalents
- Understand architectural differences
- Choose appropriate libraries

## When to Use This Skill
Load this skill when:
- Translating code between languages
