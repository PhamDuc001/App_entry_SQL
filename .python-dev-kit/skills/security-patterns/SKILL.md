# Security Patterns Skill

## Overview
This skill teaches security best practices for Python development including vulnerability prevention and secure coding patterns.

## Principles
- **Never Trust User Input**: Always validate and sanitize
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access required
- **Security by Design**: Build security from the start

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Common Vulnerabilities
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevention
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization

### 2. Secure Coding
- Password handling (bcrypt)
- Cryptographic operations
- Secure random generation
- Secrets management

### 3. Security Auditing
- bandit (Python security linter)
- safety (dependency checker)
- pip-audit (audit dependencies)
