# Cross-Language Workflow

## Overview
This workflow maps code between Python, Java, and C++, translating patterns and concepts across languages.

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Source Code
- Identify language and framework
- Understand design patterns
- Map dependencies

### 2. Map to Target Language
- Choose Python equivalents
- Apply Pythonic idioms
- Adapt to Python best practices

### 3. Document Differences
- Explain type system differences
- Note performance implications
- Highlight paradigm shifts

### 4. Provide Examples
- Show side-by-side comparisons
- Explain trade-offs
- Suggest improvements

## Usage
```
/cross-lang JavaFile.java → Python
/cross-lang CPPFile.cpp → Python
/cross-lang map Java patterns to Python
```

## Output
- Python equivalent code
- Mapping documentation
- Comparison of patterns
- Best practices for target language
